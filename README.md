Buzz Bazaar is a mobile-responsive React e-commerce store application that leverages the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to populate the store with fake data. The application features a beautiful and intuitive user interface, and the state is efficiently managed using the powerful React Redux Toolkit.
